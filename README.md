# Playwright UI + API Automation Suite

Simple fullstack app (React frontend & Node.js backend) with Playwright tests.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jovan16dj/playwright-ts-ui-api-suite-fullstack.git
cd playwright-ts-ui-api-suite-fullstack
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Start Servers & Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

**Note:** You may see a `/dev/tty` warning when running `npm test` due to how the servers are backgrounded. This warning is harmless â€” your UI and API tests will still run to completion.

**Test Plan** - see [docs/TEST_PLAN.md] for scope, coverage, and execution details.
